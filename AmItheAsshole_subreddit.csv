1,AmItheAsshole,AITA Monthly Open Forum February 2022,"Welcome to the monthly open forum! This is the place to share all your meta thoughts about the sub, and to have a dialog with the mod team.

#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

Rather than the usual message here we thought it might be helpful to use this space to take a look at a different subreddit rule each month.   Let's kick this off with rule 7:

**Post Interpersonal Conflicts**

Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""

Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.
 
 What do we mean when we say ""interpersonal conflict?"".  [Well here's the way we break it down in the FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_rule_7.3A_post_interpersonal_conflicts):
 
**What is considered an interpersonal conflict?**

* You took action against a person

* That person is upset with you for that action or thinks that action was morally wrong

* They convey that to you, causing you to question if you were the asshole for taking that action

[There's also a corresponding set of criteria we look for in a WIBTA post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_how_does_this_rule_apply_for_.22wibta.22_posts.3F)
 
Why does this rule exist?  Well, it's the core concept of the subreddit.  We are here to provide judgment on the morality of the actions of the poster in a conflict with meaningful stakes.  The criteria outlined above serve to appropriately narrow that focus.  Ensuring the OP has taken action makes sure that they have skin in the game and aren't just asking us to judge someone else.  Similarly making sure that the person they took that action against cares and takes issue with it ensures there's really something here to judge.
 
This is one of our most used removal reasons - so much so that we have 5 separate macros for it.  Rule 7 covers a lot of ground as it also ensures that posts are recent (the conflict still negatively impacting OP is one metric we look at) and don't exist solely online.  We implemented judgment bot's ""question asking"" feature where JB's stickied comment on every post contains OP's answer explaining why they think might be the asshole - helping to ensure OP explains both sides as the rule requires.
 
As with all rule violations we rely on user reports.  When you see a post you think might violate this review it can be helpful to think back to those bullet points in the FAQs and see if all three are met, keeping in mind that we consider OP's reply in the stickied comment for the full picture.

#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here. Any comments with links will be removed.

This is to discourage brigading. If something needs to be discussed in that context, use modmail.",0.81,78,0,78
2,AmItheAsshole,AITA For Not Paying the Kids that Shoveled my Driveway?,"Hello.

I am one of the many in the midwest hit by the snowpocolypse. I think we got like 14 inches where I live?

I also want to pretense this with I don't like kids. I don't hate them, I just don't have any experience with kids and haven't felt the need to produce any of my own (26F).

I work from home and received a knock at my door today. There was a group of like 4 12 yearold ish boys, and they had shoveled my driveway and side walk and were now requesting payment. They expected $15 each.

I was really confused because they never knocked to ask if they *could* shovel my drive way. They just did it without asking and were expecting to be paid.

I was really just dumb struck and kind of said ""I don't have any cash"" and one of them pulled up a smart phone saying they had their mom's venmo account.

Again, me just being extremely confused I started saying that I never agreed to pay them for anything. I was going to shovel my driveway at lunch time. If they had asked, I would have said no.

The kids got really upset, and were like ""You're not going to pay us for our work??"" But again, I didn't ask them to shovel my drive way. They started yelling at me and I just kind of shut my door.

Fast forward a couple of hours, their mom comes and knocks on the door. I open it and she started screaming at me for not paying their kids. Her points were:

- It's only $60 and clearly not going to break me (not wrong)
- They put in the work and should be paid

-Her boys did a nice thing for me
- She was proud of her boys for using their snow day to help people, and I was being really ungrateful and going to make them turn to drugs next time

This is where I started to get kind of mad. I said that I never asked for their services, and it was nice that they shoveled my drive way, but I never agreed to pay them and they really should have asked first.

She insisted I pay them this time and they'll ask in the future. But I don't want to re-enforce bad behavior. Just because they're children and people feel the need to let them get away with whatever, this is just not a cycle I want to perpetuate for these kids. You can't manipulate people into paying you for something they never asked for.

Idk, so far I've refused to pay and I'm now getting torched on NextDoor for being a heartless monster who took advantage of children.

So I'm turning to you, reddit, AITA here? If I am, I'll just pay them I guess. Idk if I'm not seeing the situation clearly because I just don't have any experience with kids.  


Edit to Add:  
A few people don't believe that I did not hear them shoveling. That's a fair thing to be suspicious of. So we did get 14 inches, but my husband and I shoveled yesterday. I'm not sure how much we shoveled vs what was left, but these kids did not shovel 14 inches on their own.  
My home office is in the far back of our house, overlooking the back yard. It's the furthest back you can get and still be inside. And 90% of the time I have headphones in for meetings or music. So I really didn't hear them.  


Other question is my drive way length. It's a 2 car wide driveway, and it's probably 2 cars long. It's pretty standard so I also felt like $60 was outrageous.",0.97,14569,0,14569
3,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting my husband's parents live in the house I own?,"I (31f) married my husband (35m) when I graduated from college and he was well within his career. We both have good degress and live in SEA country. I always wanted to pursue an academic career and wanted to pursue my phd from a good reputable European or american university and never got to do that. My husband decided that he wanted an academic career too and decided to pursue that, he already had his masters so he went for PhD in USA and he was living at a very low paycheck and well beyond his means. He had some savings from working in a corporate setting so he was able to live off of that too. 

I did my masters at my home country while working a well paying job and saved alot. We do live in a traditional household so I was living with his parents and have no expenses. This how it is in my country after wedding you are expected to live with your husband and his parents or wherever your husband allows. After my masters I got a very good opportunity for PhD with a really good grant. I was still freelancing so I had good money.

He came back to the country and basically had no savings and I at this time bought a house, he was aware of the purchase and I bought it to rent it out, with no intention of moving in and started making good money on the rent. I always wanted to do something good for my parents because my father was very poor in the beginning but he still provided me with excellent opportunities, so I purchased an apartment, nicer to what my parents live in and told my parentsto rent thier current apartment to generate more monthly income for them. My husband was not aware of this setting.

Well the cat got out of the bag, my husband's parents are furious with me because i have done nothing for them (I give his mother monthly allowance for fun money and pay for the maid that does the housework) and my husband basically has no savings and no assets. I told him it's not my fault, he demanded to evict my parents and i told him to kick rocks, he then asked me to put his name on the house deed and I wasn't thrilled to do that as well. He told me that this means divorce and I told him we don't live in US. I will still own everything and he will have to pay my father the dowry he owes. His parents asked to let them live in the house I own and it is currently bigger than what we live in, I said no to that because that will mean cutting off a decent chunk of my monthly income.

I do feel bad about his situation but feel justified in my reasoning if I put his name on anything I will have to share, I am willing to share the monthly income but he doesn't want that. I do carry his and mine expenses but that's about it. I am willing to save and buy his parents something but that will have to be in my name.
So AITA for not telling about my husband about my gift to parents and not giving him any asset.",0.98,3022,0,3022
4,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not letting in my 'boyfriend' who showed up to my college as a surprise?,"
I am a college student and in high school I dated Jon. I tried to break up with him over Christmas break this year but he said he wouldn't let me. That we had a future together and that I'd recognize my mistake in a few weeks. I told him that I'd realized I'm a lesbian and was sure. He just wouldn't accept it and said that we would talk again in a few weeks. 

Afterwards, I had gotten texts every few days from Jon telling me he loved me forever. I texted back the first few times saying we were broken up but he just didn't want to hear it. 

Then one day I was studying in my college dorm and I heard a knock on my door. It was my RA and she said that my boyfriend was in the lobby. 

It didn't even occur to me that it was Jon. My college is several states away and he has no car. 

I said that she must have the wrong person.

She said actually he said your full name and he's being kinda beliggerant with the guard, saying he traveled from (my home state) to see you. 

I was like ""holy shit no. You can't let him in. I broke up with him and he won't leave me alone, I had no idea he was even coming here let alone showing up unannounced. I need to study for an exam tonight!"" 

I was honestly panicking and she could tell. She said she would handle everything, I should just stay in the dorm and study, I'd be safe there and she'd make sure of it. 

I thanked her profusely. I tried to put it out of my mind and study, my phone had already been on don't disturb and I kept it that way and I just studied all night. I was wondering what the fuck had happened but I also knew how important the exam was going to be and that I needed to focus.

I didn't check my phone until I'd finished my exam the next afternoon, I knew whatever I saw might upset me. 

And when I finally took it off don't disturb I had a lot of messages from Jon. 

He first said that he'd come to visit me and show he wanted to work our relationship troubles out. Then he was saying the guard wouldn't let him in and could I answer my phone?

Then angry texts saying ""did you call fucking security on me?"" and then a bunch of texts saying he was here with no car and no money and nowhere to stay and he was staying up all night in a gas station because he had nowhere to go and he thought the employees would kick him out soon. 

Then a really angry text saying his mom had to give him the money to get a sooner flight home and now she might not be able to make rent. He was furious we spent 4 years together and I'd leave him out to dry when he came to try and work things out. 

I feel conflicted. I didn't want to be with him but maybe I could have helped him at least find a place to sleep till his return flight like ask my guy friends if he could sleep in the guy's dorm. I have two friends who's roommates dropped out leaving spare beds.

AITA for not talking to my 'boyfreind' when he showed up uninvited after I tried to dump him?

Edited for spelling mistakes

Second edit... Everyone who's commented so far has been saying I did the right thing and have nothing to feel guilty for, which is really kind and I appreciate but I guess I still feel guilty and feel like I have something to get off my chest about what I did wrong in the relationship and in how I ended it...

I honestly do feel kinda bad because I insisted to him and everyone else for years that I was straight. 

Even in my own head I was in denial; I knew I was attracted to women since my early teens but I tried to convince myself that I was bi, because if I was bi at least I could pass as straight in my hometown which was really not accepting. 

I really wanted to believe I could be attracted to men, and I feel like I led him on by doing that. 

I only felt comfortable to come out as bi when I was in college and found a group of really wonderful accepting friends, many of who are LGBT themselves. Then come out again as a lesbian once my friends had helped me come to terms with that. 

But all that was happening within my friend group at college, and I can see how jarring and unbelievable it could be to hear that your ""straight"" girlfriend of many years went to college for a semester and became a lesbian. And how he could believe it is a phase or I'm confused. I feel guilty for that honestly.",0.97,3507,0,3507
5,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for how I resoponded when my date called my job ""childish""?","

I (29F) got set up (again) for a blind date with my brother's friend's brother last week.


I've having terrible record with the type of men I ""attract"" but I had my fingers crossed for this one because I didn't choose him.


Well, he decided we should meet at 5 guys restaurant which felt weird to me but I sort of went with it. we met, initially he looked quite nice though he kept playing on his phone most of the date.

We talked some and when employment got brought up, I told him that I was an animator. He was stunned, he looked at me for a minute then said
""Wow, so this is an official job title now? I think it's just childish, how can you be confident enough to go around telling people you are an animator?"" I was mortified!! but I kept my cool and responded ""pretty rich coming from someone who decided that  5 guys was a good place to go for a date!. he got pale in the face and kept clearing his throat for the next 2 minutes then went to the restroom. he got back and remained quiet the whole time. It was awkward to say the least.


I went home and an hour went by and my brother called and started berating me for insulting his friend's brother and hurting his feeling with my attitude. I told him about our conversation and he told me that my date was referring yo my job but not i sulting me personally like I did to him. said that he wasn't at fault for not being able to afford a 5 star restaurant for us anyeay. but I said this wasn't the main issue and he said that I might've ruined his relationship with his friend now and should basically got off my high horse and apologize asap. I refused and he wrapped by saying ""Jesus Christ...I wonder why you're still single!!!"".

AITA for my response to him? did I go too far?",0.99,1835,0,1835
6,AmItheAsshole,AITA for allowing my stepson to call me dad?,"My wife (39F) and I (36M) got married and moved in together last year after 3 years of dating. She has a son (15M) with her ex-husband (42M). He was never abusive to any of them but he used to be extremely cold, emotionally distant and easily irritable, so my wife divorced him when the kid was 8. Since then he has constantly tried to be involved in his life but the child doesn't like him at all. He tries to ""make a man out of him"" but the son is a huge softie which is obviously an inherent incompatibility. He views his dad's approach as him not being accepting of who he is. 

I met the kiddo when he was 12. I had already been dating my wife for a year at that point and we both knew that things were going to get serious, so it was the right time. I instantly felt a connection to him, my paternal instincts spiked up. I'm sterile and I love children which is an unfortunate combination. From that moment on I started spending as much time with him as possible. The ex-husband really hated this and accused me of trying to ""steal his son"". 

After we all moved in together, I started taking care of him full-time basically, 'cause I work from home. I cook him breakfast in the morning, I pack him lunch, I drop and pick him off from school, I help him with his homework, we play video games together, workout, do sports, watch movies, listen to music, go on trips, etc. He talks with me about anything. I love him so much, I consider him my own son. 

This week he came to me crying after a meeting with his dad. The father apparently started trash talking me and telling him things such as: ""he's not your real dad, he's just a stranger"", ""he's only being nice to you to get closer to your mom"", ""he'll never see you as his own child"", etc. The poor kid actually defended me in front of his dad. I hugged him tight and assured him that I love him more than anything and that he is definitely my son. He calmed down in the end and let me know that from now on he wants to call me dad publicly and in front of everyone (he called me by my first name before) 'cause I'm his male role model and real dad and he loves, respects and admires me a lot. I told him okay, whatever he feels the most comfortable with. 

My wife's ex-husband called me yesterday to berate me for allowing this to happen, saying that because of me he'll never be able to rebuild the relationship with his son now and that I crossed some huge boundaries and I should be ashamed of myself for that.",0.97,11710,0,11710
7,AmItheAsshole,AITA for getting my kid’s dance teacher in trouble over an hour-long time out?,"My kid (8) was rude to her dance instructor, and got a harsh punishment. Am I the AH for emailing the school?

The teacher (22ish) promised she would bring treats to the class a few weeks ago, but every week she has a new excuse why she forgot them. Last week it was that she just left them on the counter, this week the teacher said the reason she forgot the treats was she had spent the previous day at a theme park &amp; got distracted.

Apparently, at this latest excuse, my kid remarked to her friend, “bet she forgets next week too. Maybe she’ll go to another amusement park.”

The teacher became livid and made my daughter sit on the floor, missing out on a nearly 2-hour class during recital season.

I’m mad because while I concede my child was quite rude, 1. The teacher had a hand in the conflict by promising candy to 8-year-olds then continuing to break that promise and 2. I paid for these dance lessons, not to have my kid crying on the floor for two hours.

Who’s the AH? (I did give my child a lecture about respecting teachers, but I also pointed out the value of keeping a promise.)

Edit- I was asked where I got this version of the story. Both parties. The teacher told me after class (including that my daughter did apologize), then my daughter confirmed it on the way home in the car.

Edit 2- AND SCENE! Everything was resolved amicably. The studio owner was very kind and is offering a make-up class. 

We had a great first semester, so this was just a bad day for all parties. Thank you!",0.97,5619,0,5619
8,AmItheAsshole,AITA for getting angry at my wife for getting my mom in a potentially dangerous situation?,"My mom (57F) recently, came over to visit me (29M) and my wife (29F). We had dinner together and my mom had like ten drinks in just two hours. After dinner, my mom was going to drive home. But she was way too drunk to drive. I was gonna tell her to stay but she had to go to work the next day. I wanted to drive her home (it's only a 30-minute drive). But my wife told me it was one of her friend's birthday tomorrow and she needed to get them a gift. There was a mall on the way between my mom's place and our home. So she decided she would drive my mom home and get a gift for her friend on the way.

But halfway there my wife realized it was 21:30 and the mall closed at 22:00. That meant she wouldn't be able to get in time if she dropped my mom home first. So, she locked my mom in the car because she was too drunk (which I think escalated the situation). And went to buy the gift. But my mom got angry when she realized my wife had locked her in the car. It took my wife 30 minutes to get back. My mom began arguing with her for locking her in the car and making her wait. But my wife took it too far. She kicked my mom out of the car somewhere near the mall and drove back home.

After my wife got home she told me about this. I was angry at her for kicking my drunk mom in the middle of nowhere at night. I was more worried because our neighbourhood isn't very safe at night and there are lots of sketchy gangs of guys around. A lot of people that's why avoid going outside late at night (especially women). I called my mom a few times and she wasn't picking up. So, I quickly grabbed my car keys and went to look for my mom. 

I looked everywhere near the mall for an hour and I was getting extremely worried. Just when I was going to call the cops about this I found my mom passed out on the side of the road not too far from the mall. I was extremely relieved, God knows what would have happened to her if she was there for longer. I took her home and she woke up the next morning.

After waking up she was mad at my wife for abandoning her in the middle of nowhere. I agreed with my mom something very dangerous could have happened to her. I told my wife she owed an apology to my mom. She said my mom shouldn't have been so rude to her. I told her my mom was drunk she didn't mean anything she said.

But she didn't listen we haven't talked in a few days. She is making me feel like an AH. But I feel like she shouldn't have abandoned my mom like that something very bad could have happened to her. So my question is AITA for siding with my mom?

EDIT: For those who are wondering my mom doesn't always drink like that. But sometimes she gets drunk like that. And my wife is currently staying with my MIL. As many of you suggested divorce. I am also thinking of divorce. She could have potentially gotten my mom killed and caused serious problems.",0.97,2040,0,2040
9,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not telling my family I’m 7 months pregnant?,"I (26 F) am pregnant with my boyfriend’s child. We aren’t married yet, but we will probably get married after the baby is born.

My parents are very judgmental about unmarried couples having babies. This makes me really nervous to tell them that I’m pregnant and unmarried. On top of that, my family has a history of delivering babies who do not survive. I’m also really anxious about that, and having them attack me would cause me even more stress. 

Given those two factors, I decided to just not tell my parents and 3 siblings that I am pregnant. They live on the other side of the country, and our only interaction is on the phone and by zoom, so it’s not exactly hard to hide the pregnancy. If the baby survives and is healthy, I was planning to tell them. If not, I might not have told them. 

In another complicated story, my sister accidentally ended up in my city due to a delayed flight, so she came to my place to surprise me. She saw that I was obviously pregnant and freaked out. She called me a lying wh*re and proceeded to call my parents to tell them I was pregnant. They all told me I was a major asshole and that there was no justification for my actions.

Like I predicted, my parents also lectured me about having a baby out of wedlock and how I should have saved sex for marriage and this pregnancy is a punishment. On top of that, I hid their grandchild from them which caused them pain. I cried the whole time and tried hanging up but they kept calling me.

The whole situation is just terrible, and I sort of feel like an asshole. I wanted an outsiders opinion. AITA?",0.97,4262,0,4262
10,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my wife to stop making my sister feel bad?,"I (30M) and my wife (30F) have been married for a year. My sister (22F) recently, got kicked out by my mom (58F) for not getting a real job. It's my sister's dream to become a content creator. She has recently reached 3k followers on Instagram. She makes vlogs about her daily life and posts them on Instagram. It doesn't generate a lot of money but I've been supportive towards her. After my mom kicked her out I let her move in with us since she had nowhere else to go.

And this is why my wife has been mad at me. She keeps telling me to tell my sister to get a real job. It doesn't help that my wife hates pets and my sister owns two cats. She even tried to convince me to throw away her cats. (My sister loves her cats more than anything). The cats also don't bother us anyway. My sister also helps us with the chores and other stuff around the house.

It's not like I am financially dependent on my wife either. I am financially stable and make more than her and pay 2/3 of the rent. I am the one paying for everything my sister needs. Our home is 3 bedroom/3 bathroom. So I don't understand what is the problem with my sister staying in one of the spare bedrooms.

So yesterday, we were having dinner when my sister told me she just hit 3k followers. She seemed so happy. I congratulated her. She was then talking about how passionate she was to become an influencer. But then my wife interrupted her saying, ""It's nice to have passions. But passions don't pay the bills, honey. And let's get real here that silly little dream of yours will probably never work out."" 

My sister was heartbroken and she went to her room crying. I went after her and told her my wife didn't mean anything she said, she was just stressed out. I told her I have faith in her that she will achieve her dreams one day. After she was alright I went to my wife and told her that was extremely mean she owes my sister an apology. But she called me a fool for supporting that silly little dream of her that will never work out. Now she's giving me the silent treatment and making me feel like an AH.

So my question is AITA for this? Thanks.",0.93,3119,0,3119
11,AmItheAsshole,AITA for leaving a child with a babysitter without the mother's permission and then being rude?,"I've been traveling for work for three months. I matched in an app with a woman who lives a few meters from my temporary apartment. After a few days of talking we met a few times and she told me that she is a single mother. We're just hanging out casually and I wouldn't say we're friends, but we talk every day.

Over the weekend she showed up at my house with her daughter I had never seen before. It was a 6 year old girl. I was quite surprised and uncomfortable with this. Angela said she had an emergency at work and couldn't find a babysitter in time. We briefly discussed how awkward it was for her to just throw a child at my house. Angela started crying saying that she had no support network and needed me. I thought that was kind of manipulative, but I agreed.

An hour passed and the girl was quiet. I put a Disney movie on TV and started making dinner. I got a call from my boss asking me to go to the office, I was kind of desperate. I talked about having a kid at home and he said he could send a babysitter to my apartment. I sent a message to Angela. When the babysitter arrived, I told her that maybe Angela would come get the child, and I went to work.

I worked for 4 hours and when I got home only the babysitter was there. She said that Angela actually picked up the girl and I paid for the service. On Monday, Angela sent several messages saying that I was an asshole for leaving her daughter with a stranger, and that she had entrusted the child only to me.

I was extremely irritated and replied that I was also a stranger. I said ""what kind of mother leaves a 6 year old girl with a guy she just met?"". I was immediately blocked on all social media. I vented to a few friends and some said it's very impolite to question a woman's abilities as a mother.

12,AmItheAsshole,AITA for throwing a family into the street?,"Okay, so it sounds worse than it is, I think.

My wife and I purchased a home back in August from a family who was waiting for the construction on their own new home to be completed. We agreed to close at the end of December, but further agreed to give them a grace period of up to three months to the end of March if their construction was delayed past the expected completion date.

They repeatedly told us they didn’t expect any excess delays and would be trying to move out of the house as soon as possible.

In November, the seller informed us that they were going to need to take the full 3 month grace period, as their construction had gotten more delayed than expected. We grumbled at the time, but accepted this, since it was in the contract and was their right to take it.

In the meantime my wife and I have been living in an apartment my parents own, waiting to move into our new home. My parents bought the place in our city so they could spend more time closer to us and to our child who is their first grandchild, born 10 month ago. My parents only plan on moving here for an extended period starting in September of this year.

The apartment we’re in is pretty small, and is not really suitable for a baby, especially one who is right on the cusp of walking. We are very eager at this point to move into the new place and make sure it has sufficient amenities for the baby, as well as for us.

In order to get things ready as soon as possible, my wife has been working to secure a contractor for a renovation of our new home which is estimated to take up to a month. We have already paid a down payment to the contractor to book him for April of this year.

So you can imagine our surprise when the seller called up about a week ago and offered to pay rent for us to extend the grace period an extra six weeks. We didn’t really want to delay further so we told them that we were sticking to the terms of our contract and that they had to give us the keys and remove all of their property from the premises by the end of March.

Today they called again and this time begged to let them stay for an extra month until the beginning of May. They said that they had nowhere to go, her mother is going into surgery at the end of the month and they don’t have a place near where their daughter is supposed to go to school.

We wanted to be reasonable, so we called our contractor to see if he could push off doing the work until May, but he’s already booked and wouldn’t be able to start the work until August, so we called them back and told them we wouldn’t be able to help, and that they would have to make arrangements for themselves elsewhere.

At this point the wife in the couple started crying and saying we were basically throwing them out onto the street. We do have a safe, free place to stay, but we are already paying the mortgage on the house that they are currently living in. So, Reddit, AITA for sticking to the terms of the contract and forcing them to leave the home?",0.98,838,0,838
13,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not allowing my wife to ban our daughter from playing he piano?,"My wife is going through a lot in her relationship with her mom right now. FIL was a really shitty dad who clearly didn’t want kids but she always thought MIL was a good mom until she realized MIL chose to stay with him. MIL admits she didn’t like how he treated the kids but he was a “perfect husband” and she wasn’t going to give up that for her kids when they would just turn 18 and leave her.

Also with us getting married 6 years ago and having 2 kids she has realized how much of an attention seeker MIL is and is distancing herself and beginning to resent her. 

Our daughter recently asked if she could play the piano and my wife made excuses and signed her up for an activity she didn’t ask for so she could say she was too busy. MIL was a professional pianist and always annoyed that my wife wasn’t musical so she has bad associations and doesn’t want our daughter to be like mil.

I told my wife that while I empathize that isn’t fair to our daughter and she needs to explore her interests. I told my wife she had a couple weeks to process but I would be signing our daughter up for lessons, as they are what she asked for",0.98,2951,0,2951
14,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my daughter she needs to stay with her mom?,"I (35M) have two kids (14F and 11M) with my ex wife Sadie. We have no formal custody agreement because we have always parented well together. We got divorced when Bella (14F) was 7 and my son Brock was 4. I stayed single for a long time and didn’t really bring anyone around my kids.

So I recently started dating again. Alyssa has a 11 year old son that plays on the same basketball team as Brock. I didn’t really see the need to say anything to Sadie because she didn’t allow me to have a say with her love life (I didn’t like one of her last bfs and she told me too bad). My son and her son really love it. My daughter and Alyssa got along very well. 

So I have no problem with Sadie hanging at my house with the kids. If she has nothing going on and wants to see our kids I’m cool with her coming over and she will spend the night sometimes in my guest room. So she stopped over about a two months ago and Alyssa was there. I was in the other room but I heard some yelling. Then Sadie barges into my office. Almost in full tears. Screaming at me about Alyssa. I could hardly even make out what she was saying. I called her once she left to get the full story. Basically Alyssa was Sadie’s childhood bully. Alyssa was a year older and picked on Sadie growing up. Sadie demanded I break up with her because she didn’t want Alyssa around her kids. I said that wouldn’t be happening. 

So talked to Alyssa about everything. She said that she hardly even remembered my ex wife. But that she remembers them being friends growing up, then having a falling out, then they didn’t like each other. She said it was mutual dislike and not bullying. I decided to call my ex and tell her that she needed to let me know if she was stopping by going forward. And that the sleepovers prolly needed to cease as well. She flipped out saying she couldn’t believe I would choose her bully over her. I told her that this happened 20 years ago and she needed to get over it. 

So now my daughter started disrespecting Alyssa out of nowhere. She went from friendly to mean in literally a month. I suspect Sadie told her something. I came home to find Alyssa crying in our room. I asked Bella what happened and she said some nasty stuff about Alyssa and that was it. I asked my son what happened and he told me that Bella was being mean to Alyssa. Bella threatened to get her mom involved. Bella also went off on Alyssa’s son. So i told Bella she needed to go to her moms to stay for a little. This has been a pattern now for weeks. Now my ex is blowing up my phone calling me a shit dad. Saying I’m picking a bully over his own family. I said I’m not. That it’s time for me to start dating again. And everyone needs to be accepting of that. That only my ex had a problem at first. But now my daughter does because of her. And that it’s time for both of them to grow up. And that Bella needs to apologize for her behavior. AITA?",0.92,1146,0,1146
15,AmItheAsshole,AITA for walking out of my sister's wedding after she tried to use me as free childcare?,"Obligatory throwaway/long time lurker disclaimer, because apparently that matters.

A few months ago my (31M) sister (29F) announced that she was going to get married. The planning process took a while but the date and venue were agreed on. Now, my sister has a baby (1M) that just loves to cry. He cries all the time, unless someone takes him outside for fresh air.

So a few days ago the wedding started. Because I was out of town I missed the night before the wedding (basically a get-together period for family members and a big party) but showed up for the ceremony and reception. The second I got there my sister asked me to take the baby outside in order to calm him down. I agreed because the ceremony hadn't started yet, but she asked me to take the baby outside again a while later. When I asked why the baby didn't have a sitter, she said that they spent all the money on the ceremony and parties.

I was kind of annoyed because I wanted to sit in on the ceremony, but just about everyone jumped on me telling me to do my sister a favour and that ""it was her day"". I asked her about when I was expected to take the baby out for fresh air, and she gave me this huge list of times that basically meant I missed out on the important parts. I wouldn't be there for the exchanging of vows, the reception, the aisle walk, the readings, the kiss, etc.

I figured out that in total I would have about 30 minutes actually sitting inside, and the rest was just about the baby. When I pointed this out to her she said someone would videotape it for me but I wasn't convinced. I wanted to watch my sister reach a milestone, and that was what I came for. I told her that someone else could watch the baby for her, and that as her brother I wanted to watch the wedding, and not have to miss her getting married. Again, she told me to ""just do it"".

I was really mad, but tried not to show it on the outside. When I asked about the reception, she told me, ""Oh, you'll have to miss out. \[Baby's name\] needs to be outside and has to be fed.""

That was the final straw, and when my mother was holding the baby I slipped out and just left. The next day I get a call from my sister, and she's screaming about how I ruined her wedding and how the baby wouldn't stop crying. I told her that I left because she treated me like a babysitter instead of a guest/family member, and said that it was her fault if she couldn't get a nanny or ask a friend to do it. Since then I've been nuked with calls from family calling me selfish and telling me that I'm effectively disowned unless I apologise. I see no reason to. AITA?",0.97,16438,0,16438
16,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not allowing my girlfriend to host a party at our house?,"So our current living situation is we live in the same house. I (26M) own the house and my girlfriend of 3 years Abby (26F) lives here. Abby is finishing up her MBA and I work full time. So Abby has a sister I’m not a huge fan of. Her sister Karson was dating this guy for 2 years and we all got close. Then karson did some fucked up stuff to her boyfriend. Stuff that I would consider financial abuse on top of cheating. After I talked with the ex and heard of what happened I decided that karson wasn’t someone I wanted to associate with anymore. I told my girlfriend this and she understood. My girlfriend and her still hangout at our place but I don’t really engage her. Karson tries to talk to me, but I’ll don’t really fuck with her and will usually leave the room. 

So karson is engaged and getting married this year. My girlfriend is the MOH and is all excited. So Abby wants to host the engagement party at our house. I’m refusing.

17,AmItheAsshole,AITA for being inappropriate with my children?,"(throwaway, and while my English is good, it's not my first language and I struggle with writing) 

My (39M) wife passed due to complications in the birth of my youngest daughter, I have been raising then since. I will be the first to admit what we had wasn't always enough for them, but I knew it was the best I could give them at the time and I got used to ignoring other people’s comments. At one point for about a year we all shared the same bed (they were around 10, 7 and 3 at the time), they would all go to bed and if there was room I would join them when I got back from work. I remember getting a lot of odd comments about it, saying it was inappropriate but I learned to ignore it.

We are doing a lot better now, my younger two do share a room but have their own beds, my oldest recently turned 18 and just got accepted into his first choice uni. I haven't had any negative comments about my parenting until recently, and for some reason, these ones are getting to me, and im thinking maybe im in the wrong this time

Basically, my eldest two used to wear my clothes, my jeans, t-shirts, hoodies. When I started earning more they could have their own, my middle child got her own, but my eldest kept wanting to wear mine. They later confessed to me that it was because they were a boy (he is trans) but even when I told him I loved him and would go with him to get his own clothes from the men's section, he still said he preferred to wear mine, saying they just had a style to them that he liked. I didn't really see an issue with it, the worst part is just when im looking for a specific shirt I may find it in his room instead of mine, but that didn't really bother me.

The thing is that some of the parents I hang out with noticed that I would wear something then a week or so later my son would be wearing it. They asked and explained that we share clothes. They started telling me how inappropriate it was, how unhygienic it is (the clothes are washed between wears and it's not like we share underwear or anything) they also said how odd some things looked on my son because they didn't always fit properly.

18,AmItheAsshole,AITA for firing my nephew after he lied about another worker stealing?,"I run a small business and for over a year and a half I’ve been employing “Brian” (not his real name). He’s a decent worker. Comes in everyday for 1 or 2 hrs to sweep, mop, clean the windows, keep the front tidy and take out the trash. 

2 months ago my sister asked me if I could offer my nephew “Henry” (19m) a job because they are going through some financial troubles and need his help. Gave him a full-time job where he’s basically like my receptionist. Answering the phone, helping me organize papers and such. The reason Henry knows about Brian is because I talked about him to my family once. Brian used to sleep right outside by the entrance every night or sometimes I’d find him digging in our dumpster around the back. So I decided to offer him some work and he accepted. Since Henry started he’s had some attitude with Brian when he comes in. Twice I came back after meeting clients, Henry was making Brian unload supplies that were dropped off. Saying that I told him to have Brian do that. They were arguing because Brian said he couldn’t do it. I was already told by him when he first started coming in that he can’t do heavy lifting because of back problems he suffers from so I got mad at my nephew over that. 

I tried to chalk that up to my nephew not really knowing much since he’s new. Last week Henry told me he saw Brian going to the back office and going through everyone’s things. Then supposedly he also went into my office. I didn’t believe him because only a few people have keys to my office, my nephew being one of them because sometimes he needs to leave papers on my desk when I’m not there. Brian doesn’t have keys for any of that because he only needs to get the cleaning supplies from the closet. 
Henry said he left his keys out front when Brian was there when he went to answer the phone and now he can’t find them. He kept saying I should fire him. 

One look at the security cams proved he lied about the whole thing. The fact that he lied about it and also kept suggesting Brian be fired for something Henry knew he didn’t do upset me very much. Wasn’t thinking at the moment because I was a little overwhelmed with anger and fired him there. You can guess how my family took that. Firing my own nephew. When according to them he didn’t do anything wrong. He suspected of the man and thought he was going the right thing coming to me. My sister said Henry just misplaced his keys and “rightfully” assumed Brian stole them and says he’s never felt comfortable anytime he came to clean.

Even though Henry won’t give me actual reasons why he was uncomfortable around Brian other than believing he would steal something. Brian has never done anything like that before. Everyone thinks I’m TA for firing/refusing to rehire him over this because of what their family’s going through and It’s getting to me. To clear the air for me, AITA?",0.97,649,0,649
19,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my daughter's boyfriend that she doesn't need his charity?,"A few months ago, my daughter Lisa (15f) confessed to me that she had a boyfriend and that she wanted to introduce him to us, because he's a very serious boy and its important for him to get along with her girlfriend's parents. I said yes and she brought him over the weekend for dinner.

When he arrived I was surprised to see him driving a brand new BMW. He was also very well dressed and brought me an expensive glass vase as a gift. He introduced himself as Elliot (17m).

Later, Lisa told me that Elliot goes to a private school and that they met at her part-time job. From the evidence, it was obvious that Elliot is upper class. I was afraid that Elliot would think that she was a poor girl that he could take advantage of, but over time I realized that he actually cares about Lisa.

The only thing that bothers me is that Elliot always gives Lisa expensive gifts: brand new books (Lisa's a bookworm), designer clothes, and jewelry. I warned Lisa to be careful or people would think she's a gold digger. Lisa explained to me that Elliot likes to pamper her with gifts, but its not big deal.

My husband and I like Elliot a lot, but every time Lisa comes home with a new gift, my husband gets sad because we could never get her something like that. I clarify that Elliot has never looked down on us and he often says that he loves our loving family, since he rarely spends time with his parents.

For her birthday, my husband and I throw Lisa a small party. I asked Elliot privately what he got for her and he said that he bought her a brand new Kindle, something that she has wanted for years. I warned him that Lisa has been saving for months to buy a second-hand Kindle. Elliot said that he already knew, but thought a new one would be better and would make her happier.

I know he didn't mean to be rude, but his words made me believe that he thought we could never get her one on our own and that it was his duty to be Lisa's ""savior"" from poverty. A little annoyed, I told him that Lisa doesn't need charity from someone who's never worked a day in his life.

Elliot didn't say anything and the party went on smoothly, but when everyone left, Lisa blew up in my face. She told me that Elliot was very sorry that I thought he was a snob and that he only wanted to make her happy. She also revealed that she has returned him most of the gifts and that she has told him to stop many times, but Elliot keeps doing it even though she loves him for him, not his money.

My husband, of all people, told me that I was rude to a nice boy and that while he doesn't like the expensive gifts, he understands that Elliot thinks if he doesn't give them to Lisa, she won't love him, because of his sad family history. I never thought of it that way and I feel a little guilty. So AITA?",0.9,1110,0,1110
20,AmItheAsshole,AITA for leaving my best friend's wedding before I gave my MOH speech?,"I've 26f been best friends with Tiffany 27f since we were both in middle school. We always talked about our dream weddings and how they'd be and it was always agreed we'd be each other's Maid of honor. 

She announced her engagement Spring 2019 and got married this January. She asked me to be her maid of honor and I was beyond excited. During 2020 we didn't see each other much due to... so we did a lot of the planning over Zoom and FaceTime. She talked about someone who I'd never met before, a woman name Xenia. She would say things like ""oh you guys can't wear that color, Xenia is wearing it."" or ""Xenia says this wine is better"". I asked about her and she simply said she was an old friend from college (we went to different colleges so it makes sense that I didn't really know her). This continues but to my knowledge all is well between us. 

The day of the wedding comes and as she walks down the aisle a woman is with her holding her arm. She kisses Tiffany on the forehead and stands in front of me beside her. I don't make a fuss about it and the ceremony continues. I ask around and apparently this woman is Xenia. During wedding party photos Xenia is either between Tiffany and I or they are taking pictures together separately from everyone else. Then comes the dinner at the reception. Originally I had 8 minutes for a speech but Tiffany's mom asked that I cut it short to 4 since 8 minutes wasn't really necessary and so on. Xenia comes on stage and says that ""she's so happy to attend her best friends wedding and that she was honored to walk her down the aisle"". Then Tiffany makes a speech and says she's so happy to have her platonic soul mate give her away and that she's never been happier. 

By now I'm completely confused and ask our friends what the hell is going on. They tell me to be quiet and don't make a scene but I'm beyond destroyed at the situation. I pull Tiffany aside and ask why she didn't ask me to walk down the aisle with her and she tells me she felt bad and didn't wanna take my MOH role away even though she wanted to give it to Xenia. She said that Xenia has been a better friend to her and brought up a petty situation that happened at her 26th birthday. She said that Xenia has been in her life a shorter amount of time but had been a better friend. I told her that if that was the case I wasn't needed any further and left without making a speech or giving a toast. 

This was on the 28th and since then I've been bombarded with angry messages from our friends and her family calling me a selfish person and saying that I absolutely had no reason to make such a scene. Tiffany hasn't reached out to apologize and our friends are saying that this proves her exact point as to why Xenia is a better friend. This all feels so unfair and I'm really questioning whether I was actually wrong to leave or not.",0.96,724,0,724

24,AmItheAsshole,AITA For Choosing College over My Best Friend?,"I know the title makes me sound selfish but here’s the full story:

Me (17F) and my best friend (17F, let’s call her Hanna) were basically childhood best friends. I met her when I was 5 through our parents and we first met at a playground. Hanna came from a wealthy background while I was from an average, middle-class one. When I first met Hanna, she seemed to be shy and polite and we seemingly got along well.

However, the polite mask is thrown away within the first month of meeting her. She became bratty and lazy, always wanting people to do the work for her. Whenever she faces any hard task, she would run away from home and I would always have to catch her.

One day when I was 5, I promised her that I would always stay by her side and I want to see her shine the most. Hanna agreed to that promise and our relationship bloomed since.

As a result, I ended up being the one to constantly take care of whatever Hanna doesn’t want to do. I bring her snacks, drive her in my car, plan her outfits, and give her the answers for any school assignment. She always wanted me to take the same classes as her so that she’ll always be dependent on me even though I didn’t want to.

This year, we’re in our senior year and  we applied to colleges. My other friend that I made this year, Maya, asked where do we want to go. Hanna proudly said Harvard and that she’s going to go with me, since she made me apply as well.

I didn’t really want to go to Harvard but I did for the sake of her. I told Maya that aside from Harvard, I looked into some in-state schools for us such as UVA and Georgetown. I also thanked Maya for helping me study for the SAT as I got a 1500+ from the study sessions after school I did with me, her, and her girlfriend.

Hanna looked really shocked when I said I was interested in the other schools. She asked me why I didn’t tell her I applied to Georgetown and UVA and other safeties. I said that it’s because I knew she was going to disapprove and that I didn’t want to go to Harvard, I wanted to go to Georgetown. Hanna was livid as she started yelling at me.

She told me that if I got into Georgetown, I should withdraw otherwise she wouldn’t be friends with me. Maya heavily objected to that, stating that I worked so hard for Georgetown and I shouldn’t give it up for someone who’s so spoiled. 

Hanna asked me why I applied to Georgetown when Harvard’s already enough. I told her that I’m not rich like her, college decisions are a gamble and Georgetown is one of my dream schools. Hanna laughed at me, stating that I would’ve never been good for Georgetown because I’m a selfish brat and when they reject me, I shouldn’t go crying to her.

We haven’t talked after that and although Maya has been comforting me, stating that I should drop Hanna, I still feel bad I went around her back and lied to her. AITA for applying to college without my best friend?",0.95,233,0,233

She met my dad at a work event (same job type, different locations, not sharing specifics for anonymity) and they started seeing each other casually for a few months and then boom, her pill, the condom, and the plan b all failed to stop me from existing. My mother was going to abort me but my father begged her not to because he was actually MARRIED and was told his wife only had like a 1% chance of ever carrying a baby to term. She agreed only on the stipulation that she can give me up, no visitation, no parenting, nothing but child support and he and his wife reached an agreement and took me under the ruse she'd raise me as HER biological daughter. Needless to say I never met my bio-mom. But it doesn't get any better for me from there. 

My step mom actually ended up having a miracle about a year after I was born. A son. My brother has NEVER treated me any different and I love him dearly but I could always tell I was never my parents priority. I more or less just kind of existed to be seen, never heard or really acknowledged unless it was something for the ""family"". 

When I turned 13 I got the opportunity to meet my bio-grandma (mom's mom). She had no idea I existed and petitioned for visitation. I loved it so much with her that I asked if I could live with her. My dad and stepmom seemed happy to be rid of me and accepted. My bio-mom never visited her mom anyway (a rift over her not settling down and having kids). Well that was 6 years ago. 

My bio-mom just died a month ago and surprisingly left EVERYTHING she owned to me with the stipulation that I go to school for business and better myself (according to her letter that the lawyer and trustee told me about).

Now my dad and stepmom are on my case to share the money. I have no idea how they found out as grandma passed last year (right after I graduated, it was her dream to see me graduate and she had been sick for a few years) and the only person I talk to is my brother but I never even told him. 

Apparently they don't have the money to send him to an ivy league school like they've always wanted, but money is no longer an object for ME. I know they raised me for 13 years, but this money could really change my life. AITA if I don't share it?",0.95,171,0,171
