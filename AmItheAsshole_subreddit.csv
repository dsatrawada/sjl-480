0,AmItheAsshole,AITA for wanting to give practical gifts?,"AITA for thinking that practical gifts area good thing? My wife enjoyed tonight's dinner, but was annoyed when she realized we no longer have any of the glass containers she likes to use to take food to work. I connected that I now knew something I could get her for her birthday. She got mad because she doesn't want things she needs for her birthday, but things that she *wants*.

I guess I don't get it. If I need something, I want it. Sometimes I want things I don't need (I think that's okay for everyone), but I wouldn't be upset if someone gave me something I needed for a gift. Heck, we've always taught our kids that they should be grateful when they receive a useful gift, even if it wasn't what they wanted. AITA?",1.0,1,0,1
1,AmItheAsshole,AITA for ignoring my friend,"My friend, lets call him Cooper, texted me earlier today saying that he wanted to hang out with me during lunch. 
This has happened a few times in the past. I used to sit at lunch all the time, but when he got a girlfriend I left because I was just a third wheel. 
Whenever his girlfriend occasionally has a doctors appointment or is absent that day, he texts me saying that we should hang out during lunch. I have accepted a few times in the past, but I’ve made my mind up that I don’t want to be the Second choice friend. He doesn’t even like text me or check in or think about me until his girlfriend is absent for whatever reason. Even when I make attempts to hang with both of them, I am always in the background while they’re having a conversation between themselves.
Today he texted me again inviting me to hang out at lunch, probably because his girlfriend isn’t here and I didn’t reply. I didn’t even open his message. I just hung out with myself.
I just want to know if my course of action is justified and if my thought process is rational.",1.0,1,0,1
2,AmItheAsshole,AITA for being mad at my girlfriend for spending more time with another man then me?,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for about 6 months now. The first 4 months went extremely well with no major arguments happening. This all went wrong when she got back in contact with an old friend. Now this old friend used to be extremely close to my girlfriend, having very strong feelings for her yet she did not share the same. This old friend was also an extreme asshole to me when I used to be friend with him, making fun of all my insecurities and tormenting me for the 3 years I knew him. 

At first my girlfriend ensured me that she would not get close to him. This obviously all changed when she started spending more time with him than me. Obviously we would still have our nights out at the weekends but during the week she wouldn’t spend a single minute with me. When I first confronted her about this she said that it’s much more fun playing with him and that I’m boring. I was obviously really hurt by this but let it go because of how much I love her. 

The next incident happened around my birthday, when she spent the entire day with this guy even though I had asked her multiple times to spend a bit of time with me. The next few months went extremely rocky, arguing about this situation but also getting along really well.

This is where I think I might be in the wrong. My girlfriends relative recently got diagnosed with a disease that did not look great. She is extremely close to this relative and Obviously for the first couple weeks I made sure she was okay, getting her whatever I could and checking up on her frequently. That was until this week, I had asked her to dedicate a single hour of her time to me, she said she would until the last minute where she told me to go away before going off with the aforementioned old friend. I was extremely angry at this. Confronting her on why she refuses to spend a moment of her time to me yet dedicates it all to this old friend. She claims that it is simple jealousy and that I’m pissing her off by asking so much. 

Well that’s all for now and I hope everyone that reads this has a great day, thanks.",1.0,1,0,1
3,AmItheAsshole,AITA for making my brother pay for replacement AirPods?,Each night I fall asleep listening to music and when I wake up their usually missing and scattered on my bed. Today once I woke up I forgot to put them back into their case since I was in a rush and running late for school. Once at school I check my airpod case and realized I had only put one of them back. Once I saw this I asked my brother who was home if he could check on it. He ignored my messages then proceeded to go into a groupchat that includes me and a few of our friends and asks if they want to play games with him. We have a ps4 that I paid for fully since he broke our last one. I texted him more times and still got ignored. I get home and I find my airpod chewed up by HIS dog. I’m 16 and have a job. I had just bought the AirPods 3 days before. He’s 18 and basically good for nothing. He recently became unemployed and spends all his time playing on my console and depends on me to give him gas money so he can go out. I told my mom I wanted him to pay fully to replace my airpod since it’s no longer functional and she told me it was a bad idea. Should I make him pay up?,1.0,2,0,2
4,AmItheAsshole,AITA for cooking in my apartment?,"I (19F) have two roommates (both 20F). I take my nutrition very seriously, this includes cooking almost every meal. Before we moved in, I let them know this and they had no issues with it. Roommate A let us know that she brought some kitchen stuff for us to use, but i also brought my own stuff anyways. We moved in in August. A week before valentine’s day, Roommate A texts the apt group chat a huge paragraph saying that she’s sick of dirty pots and pans being “piled” in the sink so she can’t use them, as well as that one of her pans is “stained beyond repair”. She says she’s been pissed about it since August. Im the ONLY one that cooks so this was directed solely at me. I say that i don’t always have time to put dishes away right after i use them and clean them. i DO clean the dishes after every time i use them, but our dishwasher doesn’t work so there’s no point in putting them in there. I lay them out on the counter on a towel. The only instances i dont clean the dishes immediately are when i occasionally make dinner for my boyfriend and don’t do them so i can spend more time with him (we don’t see each other often), but the next morning my priority is to clean the dishes. I went out and checked all her pans, there were no stains on any of them that i could see. I told her if she wants to keep her stuff to herself i’ll do the same. In her reply she begins cursing and insulting me. Our apt is dead quiet all the time, but she gets upset that i listen to audio that even i can barely hear while cooking. In short she makes up all these complaints, which are all objectively false, and told me this apartment stays disgusting because of me. I do not touch any other part of the apartment other than the kitchen, and it honestly looks like no one even lives here. That’s how clean it is. 
It’s important to note that i make a particular effort to be clean in the kitchen because my dad would always chastise me for it growing up.
She texted a day later and said she should’ve gone about it better, then proceeded to say the same things she was saying before in a similar tone. I told her “i don’t know who you’ve gotten away with talking like that to, but it ain’t gonna be me”. I said if she didn’t want problems she shouldn’t have been aggressive and belittling. I grew up letting people walk all over me and im making an effort to stand up for myself in adulthood. I told her, as i told her many times the day before, she should have come to me as a mature adult instead of throwing a fit and this would have never been an issue. Now we aren’t on speaking terms but this has been eating me up the past week. There’s much more to this conversation but this is long enough. AITA?",1.0,1,0,1
5,AmItheAsshole,AITA for telling my relative that they're ruining their reputation?,"I heard that one of my distant relatives is doing a temporary job despite already having signed another offer. They are young and have just started their career.

After they told me that the temporary place hired them with the intent of potentially bringing them on permanently and also the fact that they didn't tell the temporary place that they already had other accepted offers, I told them they were burning their bridges with that place and that it would affect their career and network. Like...these people are investing time and money into you for you to just...leave??? 

They told me that some younger people they asked said it wasn't a problem and that companies don't care about employees so why shouldn't they take advantage of this opportunity to earn more money and stuff like that and to get more experience.

I just told them that young people seem to hate the companies that literally pay for their bread and butter and that they're so anti-company for no good reason and are so entitled and selfish these days.

6,AmItheAsshole,"AITA For saying the n word, the getting bullied for it?","Here’s a little context: 
I have ADHD so sometimes I say things without thinking, I’m not using it as an excuse, I’m just putting it out there. IMO I’m an asshole for this, and I understand the title sounds really bad it’s not. This happened back in October, and it’s bugging me ever since… 

Im a freshman in HS and I go to a public high school in a predominantly white rural community. I was coming home on the bus on a Friday, and my friends and I were jokin around about god knows what. One of my friends is black and he, out of nowhere, goes “n— balls.” we’re all completely unfazed because he’s black, he can say it, whatever. We’re not racist and know our boundaries. then my friend is like “yo say it u won’t” just referring to me saying the n word. So I say it…

Jk. I don’t say it,  I go “fine, ni-“ and I cut it off right there. We’re just jokin around, and it wasn’t targeted at anybody and wasn’t said fully. 

Flash forward to Monday, I’m sitting eating my lunch like usual, and some kid (let’s call her S) walks up to me with 3 of her little buddies. S is black and her friends are white. 

“You stupid b**ch.”
“*blank stare* excuse me…?”
“You heard me. Why the f did you say ni— on the bus huh? White a*s pu**y. Gimme an answer b**ch.”
“…what are you talking about…?”
“I have you on video and yo a*s finna go to the principal.”
“I have no clue what you’re talking about…”
“Uh-huh, white fuc**n pu**y. Fess up ni—.”
“*Finally realizes* oh, I didn’t say it fully, it wasn’t targeted at anybody, my friend told me to say it as a joke. Sorry if it offended you.” (Not said in a snarky way, I was just telling her calmly)
“Whatever, fu** off b**ch.”

Flash forward a month, and I’m called down to my principals office. I had a partial idea of what this might be, but I was thinking it was about my ADHD or something (also want to add here, the incident happened before I was given meds for my ADHD). So we chat about nonsense, and he’s like “I have a report here that you might have said the n word on the bus..?” So I confessed and told him everything that happened that was previously mentioned above. He said “yea, that’s fine. The kid that reported you said there was a video but there wasn’t anything. Just watch what you say in public next time.” 

Ever since I got called into the office, I see S in the hallway with her friends and continuously get dirty looks and shoved from them. I don’t do anything, I just take it with “pride” per say, and try not to escalate the problem. 

I saw them in the locker room about 2 weeks ago, but because it was between bells it was me and them. I was getting ready for gym, but I’m in my own world staring at the wall thinking about god knows what. I feel a shove, and S is like “whatchu starin at pu**y a*s white b**ch? F**kin n-.” And her friend, “*flips me off* f*cktard.” 

I’m not too proud of the whole situation and I felt like I needed to truly clarify whether or not I’m an A hole.",0.5,0,0,0
7,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not wanting to hear about my best friend's trip while I'm having a bad time?," So my best friend is currently on a trip to France, chaperoning their sibling and their sibling's friends. It has been my dream to go to France since I was a kid so naturally, I was a little jealous but still excited for them to go. If anything I was looking forward to them going because our interests and personalities is so similar, it would've been like I was there by proxy. I knew about the trip for months, and I wanted to hear all about it. But as of late, in the last two weeks, my financial problems have started to become more present. Me not making a lot of money has stonewalled a lot of my goals and dreams over the years.  It hasn't been anything too knew. However, in the last couple of weeks, my hours got cut in my minimum wage job. I'm behind on payments, my parents haven't really helped lessen the anxiety with their hyperbolizing even simple financial situations. It's thrown me into this unexpected depressive episode, it's gotten so bad l upped the dosage on my antidepressants. 

 That brings me to the situation with my best friend. They're on the trip now. And I knew I was going to be a little envious but it was worse than I thought. The first couple of pictures I got back made me sad. Then turns out a lot of the people I went to college with were on fun trips too and broadcasting these great life updates, it's part of the reason I deleted Instagram and Facebook off my phone.  Then my best friend sent me the rest of their itinerary for the trip and that's when I lost it. It was essentially my dream itinerary for a trip to Paris, and with everything going wrong lately, I've never wanted to be on that trip more. I cried hard after that, damn near had a panic attack (the best friend doesn't know this happened). After consulting with my two other best friends, I told the one in Paris to not send any more updates. To take pictures and have a great time but I wasn't in the best headspace to hear about the trip yet.  They seemed fine with it (even saying to stop saying sorry lol) but I can't help but feel like a piece of shit anyway. They were having a tough go of it too before this so I really want them to have fun. As far as I know, I'm the only one they'd been reporting back to because 1) we have a shared interest and 2) I'd originally asked. I'm really hoping I didn't come off as too jealous or if I maybe cut their excitement.

8,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not hating my ex?,"I, 20F, have been in a relationship with my girlfriend, 19, for about a year. Recently, I attended an exposition to promote the clubs available in my college campus, and decided to check out each booth and talk to everyone. I had a blast, until I got to a booth that (to my unawareness) my ex (20M) was working. By the time I noticed his presence I was already right in front of the booth and we were both making eye contact. I did not want to be weird or rude so I simply smiled and greeted him and he did the same before I moved on to the next booth. 

My ex and I only dated for about 2 months before I ended things a year before getting with my current girlfriend. I was simply not into him romantically and we both agreed to drop it and be cool, but we never talked again. Now my girlfriend is PISSED about this interaction we held at the booth. I told her that unlike her ex (whom she wishes she was dead) I had no hard feelings towards my ex, and I honestly did not care about it at all. When I pointed out that her profusely hating on HER ex made HER seem like she still cares about her she got even more furious and now won’t speak to me.

9,AmItheAsshole,AITA for making my mom wait for over an hour at my friend's house when she was picking me up?,"I (14f) went to my friend's house yesterday. My mom said she'd pick me up around 6pm.

My friend and I ended up watching a movie, and I lost track of time. My mom got to the friend's house a little before 6pm and waited in the car for me to come outside (without knocking or anything).

I didn't know she was there, because she's always come to the door before, I just thought she was late.

We kept watching the movie, and it ended up being about 7pm before I realized she was probably in the driveway. I went to check, and she was there. I realized she'd been there for a while and just had not come to the door, but had expected me to come outside at 6pm.

So I put on my shoes and jacket really fast, said bye, and got in the car.

During the 10 minute drive home, my mom yelled at me for not coming outside when she said she'd be here at 6, I wasted her time, so inconsiderate of me, she said she'd be here at 6 etc.

I said that if she was so mad about wasting time, why didn't she call, text, or even knock.

She said it isn't her job to do that when it was me being lazy and forgetful, she said she'd be here at 6.

She's still mad at me, and now I'm not sure. I probably should have checked, but I didn't realize she was there and maybe I wasn't thinking. AITA? 

Edit: forgot to add to the original post. My mom has always knocked in the past, and has also been late a lot. So I thought she was just late because she hadn't knocked. ",0.63,2,0,2
10,AmItheAsshole,AITA for shutting down repetitive robotic conversations?,"I really **really** hate the repetitive menial questions and wooden responses that seem to worm into every single day of our lives. The kind of conversations that we start just to be polite, out of obligation, and neither of us care at all about the topic itself. Like talking about the weather, I can't stand the old,

*""How's it going?""*

*""Not bad/doing well, and you?/still breathing/another sunny day/etc""*

Frequently I'll respond in ways that totally shut down the conversation. I'll give a quick one-word response and then rush into, ""What do you want? Here it is. Goodbye."" Sometimes in a store if I'm asked, ""How are you?"" I'll say, ""Absolutely awful, thank you."" Just because it normally makes things awkward enough that they give up and let me go without further question. Yes, I could spice up my own contributions to make them more interesting but *why*? Why invest that, when I know neither of us were invested in the conversation to start with?

The worst example is my wife. **Every day** I get home and she asks, ""How was work?"" which is sweet, it is. It's nice that she gives me space to vent or discuss my plans and my headspace. Except... work is the same nearly every day. The same as yesterday, the day/week/month/year before. If something changes, I've usually already brought it up. 

I'm left using wooden robotic responses just to exit the conversation as quickly as possible. ""It was fine."", ""It was busy."", ""It was decent."" and I'm just **so** tired of trying to bring myself to care about having that discussion. 

I've expressed that it bothers me. Expressed that it makes me feel like I'm living in a Groundhog Day hell to have to repeat the same conversation **every single day**. It changed nothing. Every day I still get asked the same questions with the same replies. At least in my own house I'd like to get away from it, even if I can't control strangers and their pre-programmed NPC voice lines.

11,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not chipping in for someone's birthday cake," So I (19 Nonbinary) and a few other people were put into a group chat about celebrating someone's birthday. For context, we are all college freshmen and we've only known each other for 6 months. The birthday person in question, we'll call him Alex. He is one of my least favorite people I have met. He's made gross jokes about S A, tried to kiss someone without her permission, made race jokes, among other things. So I don't like him, and many other people in my group feel the same.

One of my roommates made the group chat for his birthday, and I didn't say anything in it. I planned on just not going and getting dinner with a few friends that night. But then, a message is sent to the group, ""We got a cake, pie, and a lego set. if everyone chips in $2 it should cover it."" from Alex's roommate. Two of my friends and I immediately talked amongst ourselves about if this guy was serious. One of my friends, we'll call Val, she messages the chat saying that she didn't know that she would have to pay. Now my roommate walks into Val's room and asked what's the big deal about $2? Val explained that it wasn't about the money, it was that Alex's roommate didn't even ask if it would be okay if everyone chipped in. (and many of the people in the group felt the same).

It's the day of the party and Val, another friend, and I go out to eat so we don't run into the group having their party. In the middle of eating, we get a text from someone at the party. Apparently, my roommate was shit-talking not only Val but our other friend and me for not chipping in the $2. And all the people that agreed with our stance still went to the party and didn't say anything when we were getting shit talked although they agreed with us. Only one person did (she was the one that texted us that my roommate was talking shit).

Now I understand that the three of us may seem cheap or something along those lines for not just giving them $2 because it is only two dollars. But considering that we weren't going to go to the party, eat the cake or pie and that we weren't even friends with Alex in the first place, I don't think that we should've had to give them our money for something that they didn't even tell us that they were getting.

12,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to take in my partner's cat?,"Hi guys, I know how it sounds but hear me out!

My cat is my world, he's about 2 years old and a few months ago, we lost his best buddy due to a traumatic accident. It's been rough on me.

Meanwhile, we're actually buying out my partner's ex. It's been a long and BUMPY road to finally get her to agree to move out. Since we started talking about this a year ago, I've always been clear, I'm very happy to take in their old dog, but his ex needs to take the cat. My cat is an indoor cat, the other cat is an outdoor cat. That means he brings health &amp; escape risks for my cat. Additionally, I recently lost my pregnancy and I cannot bear the thought of another miscarriage due to toxoplasmosis, even if it's just a small chance. Anyway, it never was a problem, his ex was happy to take the cat.

Today, however, that changed. Or actually, it changed weeks ago, my partner just didn't tell me. Apparently, when his ex agreed to moving out, she decided she wouldn't take the cat with her after all, because it was harder to find a rental. My partner agreed to this without talking to me and then went on to hide that information from me. Since then, we've made some expensive commitments like engaging the solicitor.

We're now in the middle of the buying process and regardless of how anyone feels about my reasons - I've been super clear on many occasions regarding not wanting to take the cat in. My partner keeps trying to convince me I'm wrong and has painted me as this horrible evil person for denying a cat. But it's not the first time I feel like he's not taken my stance and feelings seriously - only to subtly push through his stance and eventually force my hand.

Now, he's made it clear that my options are pulling out of the house purchase completely OR taking in the cat. I feel horrible, I don't want to do either and I hate that he put me in this position and made me into this person that refuses an innocent cat. Especially as he has 2 wonderful kids who will be affected. AITA?

Now my male friend and I want to move in together to save on rent. My bf is extremely against it saying I can’t move in with him because it’s only to save money which is a shallow reason. He said him and my sister were to keep each other company which is apparently not a shallow reason because it’s for their mental health. I told him just like he did to me I can move in because he can’t control me just like I can’t control them. He got angry and said I was only sort of against the move in where as he is extremely against my male friend I living together so that’s the difference. I ignored him and moved in and he said he wouldn’t visit me until I moved back out alone.

I live in an apt complex that allows cats only. I have been living here about a year and I renewed my lease. However, the neighbor that shares a wall with me attempted to sneak a dog into their apartment. It happens last November. At first they were trying to hide it. That did not work. The dog barked for hours. Then when I contacted the landlord it was suddenly an emotional support animal. Then a couple weeks ago while I was changing out my laundry they come walking out with the dog. The dog now has a service vest on. Mind you the dog barks for HOURS on end. This morning I had enough. The dog started barking at 4 am and was barking until I left for work at 7 am. So I called the non emergent line and told them my neighbor has a “service” dog that has been barking and I was worried something was wrong. 

It is obvious they are abusing the title of service animal and it makes me mad. It also makes me mad to be woken up by this dog constantly barking. For hours on end.

15,AmItheAsshole,AITA For Inviting Sister's Ex?,"When my \[30m\] son Michael \[8m\] was born, my sister, Tate \[28f\] was engaged to her high school sweetheart, Finn \[27m\]. Their daughter \[8f\] was born 4 months after our son, so they have always been incredibly close. When they dated, Finn was always extremely close to our family and was a very involved, fun Uncle. It was Finn who first introduced Michael to playing field hockey and football (aka soccer), both of which he still loves. 

Three years ago, Tate and Finn split. Tate now has a new fiance, Aaron \[31m\], who is the father of her second child \[2f\]. Aaron is far less interested in having a relationship with me, our mother or my son. Tate has barred Finn from our family entirely, preferring to pretend as if he does not exist, which is probably not the best method of co-parenting. 

Despite this, Finn still works as a trainer at the local gym. He no longer coaches Michael’s team, but we still see him there occasionally and he was enthused and interested to learn that Michael had started playing football (aka soccer) for his school this year. As our children are cousins, he still takes his role as ‘Uncle’ in Michael’s life seriously and has tried to stay in touch the best that he can without upsetting my sister. 

Michael had his first ‘away’ game against another school, so I invited Finn to watch alongside my girlfriend, my mother and I. Unbeknownst to me, my mother had convinced Tate, Aaron and their kids to attend, although they’d previously told me they would not. Tate was insulted that I had invited Finn as she sees it as me undermining the rules she’d set ousting him from our family and it offended Aaron. She also doesn’t want to encourage Michael to see Finn as an uncle anymore as Aaron should take that role now and she doesn’t want to get her daughter’s hopes up that they will get back together, which she worries may happen if Finn spends too much time with our family. 

I did not realise that this would hurt my sister so much and I do understand that she has moved on now, so Finn is in her past, but I wanted Michael to be surrounded by people who support him for his game and Finn is one of those people. I expected my mother to agree with me as she likes Finn, but she agreed that these events should be for family only, which Finn no longer is, or else it will confuse the children. AITA?",0.86,5,0,5

17,AmItheAsshole,AITA for not being able to afford a trip out of country with my boyfriends family?,"I know the title seems obvious, but hear me out. 

I (21 F) started dating my boyfriend (20 M) in High school 3 and a half years ago. We met sophomore year and we are both still together, going to the same university, and I do, in fact, love him very much. He’s genuinely very patient and kind with me.

A couple months ago, His mother, who has been nothing but kind and generous with me, told me to start saving up for a trip. They take a family trip every couple years (2-3) and due to Covid, this is their first trip in a long time, and she told me I absolutely had to go this time. I didn’t mind at first, and then she told us that she was paying for half.

Great! I thought. It shouldn’t be more than a couple hundred-

$1700.

Because my boyfriend makes significantly less than me, I was expected to pay 1700$ for our half to go in July. 

I Am a manager at a fast food restaurant, and I work part time since I go to school full time. I pay my own rent, utilities, phone bill and WiFi (that I split with said boyfriend and 2 roommates) and I pay for all my food and school stuff myself. I take out student loans to help with a lot of expenses as well, which is why I have some saved up (enough to pay for the majority of the trip.) I was more than happy to pay, though, since I’ve never been out of country.

Now, my boyfriend graduates this semester, and he will be moving once he finds a job and will be leaving my city. I have to find a new apartment and get a car (I’ve been using his.) which means a new apartment Deposit, first months rent, pet deposit (we share a dog) and a down payment on a vehicle. Now, it was going to be tight, but I would’ve been able to do it if I picked up a few shifts-

My job got a new boss and my hours are being cut. I have to find a new job.

I felt defeated. I looked over my finances, my upcoming bills, new bills I’d have to pay without my boyfriends help, and I decided I could not afford to pay for this trip. I was heartbroken and told my boyfriend, who got very upset.

He wants me to pick up a few more shifts and find a new job so I can pay for everything I need. He says once he gets his full time job, he will help me with expenses, and his mom is paying for half the trip. He’s upset also because we’ve been planning this for months, and it is kinda crappy of me to spring this on him on short notice, since he now has to pay for his ticket half.

18,AmItheAsshole,AITA For setting up my girlfriend?,"So my girlfriend (19f) and me (19m) met roughly a year ago, we've just recently started dating around march 2021. Around December she started acting really weird, not answering calls or texts when she was ""out"" and saying that she was tired and didn't wanna talk. So one day I decided to go into the bathroom and told her I was showering, turned on the water and I went on another snapchat account I had. I added her and talked to her for a bit, after some time I asked if she had a boyfriend, she said yes and I started gaining hope, I asked if I could meet him, she said yes after asking her a bunch. A second later some guy had added me, let's call him Daniel now my name isn't Daniel. He said to stop harassing her girlfriend, which I told him what I was doing because I thought she was cheating. He said I was lying and blocked me. I took screenshots, sent them to my girlfriend and came out of the bathroom asking her about it. Which she said: ""what's this?""
me: ""that's what I wanted to ask.""
gf: ""dude what the fuck.""
me: ""what do you mean?""
gf:""you set me up.""
me: ""you cheated on me.""
gf:""that's not cool dude""
me:""how is that not cool? You cheated on me and you won't even admit.""
gf:""you set me up you obviously don't trust me""
After that she threw a tantrum and left the house, blocked me on everything.

19,AmItheAsshole,AITA for getting upset at my boyfriend for not going to the gym with me?,"This sounds weird ik but let me explain. 

I have been talking about wanting to go to the gym for about a month now and asked my boyfriend to go with me because I am pretty scared to go alone.  I told him he doesn’t even really have to do anything if he wanted just walk on a treadmill lowest setting i mean it didn’t matter to me I just needed someone there with me while I learn the ropes and he would only need to go with me like three times so I could be comfortable going by myself. I feel like it is extremely hard to get him to do things that I want to he always says “I don’t want to” or “I don’t feel like it” when ever I say I want to do something. 

A few examples of this was when I wanted to go to a haunted house for my birthday. He told me he didn’t want to that year but next year we could. Next year came and he claimed he never said that and that he doesn’t like haunted houses which I get it some people can’t handle being scared so I let it slide. He won’t play the two player video games that I want to like it takes two cause again “I don’t want to” but he said he was going to play one of those two player games with his friend until I confronted him about it and he said it “was a joke” cause I was upset about it. Another is that we went to a water park and he refused to ride the rides I wanted to but went back to the same water park with his friends he rode all the big rides with them saying “I can’t chicken out in front of the boys” now I told him all month I wanted to start going to the gym twice a week starting today. He agreed to go with me for support then half a week later would complain about how he doesn’t want to go and I would talk to him about how it’s just to support me so I don’t have to go alone he doesn’t even have to work out and he would say he would go and this happened about three times. Today comes and I ask him when he wants to go to the gym and he whines again about how he just wants to relax and doesn’t want to go to the gym. I told him I shouldn’t have to force him to do the things I want to do and that I try not to ask him for much but I shouldn’t have to force him to support me. He’s claiming he wasn’t trying to bail on me and that he just wanted to relax since we didn’t have class today. 

AITA for wanting him to go to the gym with me?

PS I just want to state that I go out with him pretty much whenever he wants as long as I’m not working. He doesn’t even have to ask he just says hey Friday we are going out with X and Y (his friends) and I’m like okay what are we doing?",0.5,0,0,0
20,AmItheAsshole,AITA for disinviting my (27F) parents from my wedding after finding out how they met each other and got married?,"My wedding is coming up soon and my parents were telling me about how they met. They started telling me how ""romantic"" their story was. Long story short, my dad was married to someone else and they were trying to get pregnant but they couldn't. He started having an affair with my mom, who worked with him and knew about his wife and them trying to get pregnant, and my mom got pregnant with me. When this happened my dad left his ex wife and married my mom.

&amp;#x200B;

I was shocked when they told me this, not just by what they were telling me but they were so relaxed (is that the right word?) about it. I knew they met at work but I didn't know anything about this. I blew up at them and told them they were horrible people, and a few hours later I texted them that I was disinviting them from my wedding. This was yesterday. They're telling me they thought I would be able to understand now (because I'm getting married I'm supposed to understand why my dad had an affair?) and I'm overreacting.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I made the right choice. They're good parents. Honestly, I wouldn't even care if they admitted they hurt people or showed any guilt. But they were literally bragging about how ""romantic"" it was and now I can't stop thinking of the poor woman my dad left behind, and how I'm part of the reason this all happened. I can't think of my parents the same anymore either. My husband is saying I should try to forgive them but he will support me either way.

21,AmItheAsshole,AITA for being angry at my brothers for going into business with my “one that got away?”,"Background- it was my first love. I was young but I knew what I wanted. Not only did the relationship end on a bad note, but my entire circle of friendship and social life ended with it. It was a very hard time in my life. I moved 500 miles away to get over him. 

In 2020, let’s just say my family (my parents and siblings) and I didn’t agree on much. They went Far Right and criticized everything I did as it differed from their opinions of what was happening in the world. My son (who has a heart condition) was my main concern and I definitely got a little high-anxiety on my end. I was angry a lot and confused and scared and I told my brother that his support of certain current events was shameful and not Christ-like (we are all Christians). I did apologize later for being mean about how I said it (although it was true).  

About a month after January 6th, my brother invited me over for dinner. He announced (with my husband and children present) that he and my other brother had gone into business with my ex. I was shocked to say the least. I had spent the last 15 years trying to forget the guy existed and while I 100% love my husband and my current life, it’s still hard to forget someone who you thought was your soulmate. All I could think of was that now I have to hear about him as my bothers love to talk about their work. 

A couple days later, my husband told my brother he thought he should apologize to me for not even considering my feelings before he announced it in front of everyone. My brother called me, I missed it. I called back, he missed it and never called again. I texted him 3 days later that I was hurt by him and even though I realIe he probably wasn’t doing it on purpose, it was really awful the way he went about telling me after the fact. He said “I’m not doing this over text.” I didn’t want to call him but I did. He was brutal. Told me I wasn’t worth thinking of and that I was a bad sister and how should he have known I had my heart broken (he knew…) when this guy dumped me. He told me I wasn’t wise and he would never come to me or my husband for “wise counsel.” I was sobbing by this point begging him to stop and that’s when I told him that I thought he had let greed and money/power hunger rule his life lately and was very hurt by him. I never got an apology aside from “that wasn’t my intention and I’m sorry you feel that way.” 

My family is very close. We had dinner together most Sundays. I told my mom I wouldn’t be coming for a while while I processed what happened. My dad said I was being dramatic. He later told me he blames me for “tearing the family apart” and for “blaming my brother for what happened.” Recently, my mom also said that my not coming back into the family dinners and avoiding holidays is childish and vengeful and that I don’t realize how mean I am to people. I did blanket apologize to them for anything I said that was unknowingly hurtful. AITA for not wanting to be a part of family events any longer?",0.62,2,0,2
22,AmItheAsshole,AITA for wanting the money i saved to come with me from my dads?,"So ive been saving money for a year or more now whenever im at my dads. I put all my loose change in a jar. Recently, we went and got the change counted and turned into cash, that came out at ~$90-$100. I had asked my dad if i could take it back home with me, seeing as how i only see him every other weekend, and live with my mom.

23,AmItheAsshole,AITA for jokingly saying I'll wear white to my best friend's wedding?,"

My (26f) best friend (27m)and I  have been best friends since primary school. We used to do everything together and sometimes both of our parents would joke about how we are going to end up getting married and after that we always joked about being like a married couple. That was a joke we had since childhood and we had no romantic feelings for each other at all. We also had a running joke about how we'd actually marry each other if we were both 30 and still single. I'm being honest all of that was a joke nothing more. When he started dating his fiancée 5 years ago he immediately put an end to these jokes, he stopped joking around with me like that and I was hurt and whenever I used these jokes he'd tell me to stop it. This hurt my feelings a lot because our friendship and our inside jokes suddenly stopped once he got a gf.

Tbh his fiancée never seemed to like me and there are many examples of her being jealous of me. My friend and I kept being friends but he had actually changed his attitude towards me by a lot. Once in a while I'd throw one of these jokes around and he'd side eye me as a hint to stop.

A month ago he threw a surprise proposal/engagement party for his fiancée. Some of our friends were included and invited but I was not for some reason. I told him I'm mad that he wouldn't consult me about the engagement, the ring or the party and he said that this isn't about me and he didn't have to do shit to please me. He was really mean to me and I was starting to get tired.

I've tried time and time again to prove that the jokes we had were simply jokes and nothing more but they wouldn't care. One time I met them after their engagement party at my bff's bday party and I jokingly said to his fiancée ""oh look at you, you're so gorgeous that you managed to steal my future husband and made him yours, wouldn't mind if I wore white to the wedding so I can at least be a bit happy too?"" I was saying all that in a sarcastic joking manner but the bride and her parents got offended and my bff was mad at me. I explained I was simply joking and that I wasn't planning to wear white and I'm actually planning to wear my favorite emerald dress. Once I said that the fiancée realised I was talking about a dress my bff had bought me and she was LIVID and idk why she was mad with the emerald dress. My bff told me to leave and that we need to have a talk at one point.

Later I find out that I was uninvited. My bff said the decision was his and his fiancées. But I'm almost certain the decision was not his but only the bride's and her parents since they're paying and my bff can't argue with that.

Some of our friends who were present said I brought this to myself and that's what I get for acting like an AH but they shouldn't uninvite me and should give me a second chance. AITA?",0.83,27,0,27
24,AmItheAsshole,AITA for calling my stepparents mom and dad?,"My parents are divorced and remarried as everyone can see from the title and its always about them, new spouses, and their new kids.

I am the floater because apparently I did something terrible in a former life to be in this position (the extra)

no one listens to me because apparently to them, 2 homes is better than one and my opinion doesn't matter. Once I told them that if 2 house is better they should switch and not me but I got told to cut the attitude so please no one tell me to try and talk to them again because I have tried

So I decided to call my stepmom, mom, and my stepdad, dad, because my parents told each other that I was not allowed to call any new partner mom or dad when they got divorced

Since they expect me to be ok with jumping from house to house like a kangaroo and accepting of their choices  I decided that it was unfair that they won't let me call my stepparents mom and dad and integrate fully.

Now I don't view my stepdad and stepmom as parents because I don't like them but I have to listen to them so I fake kindess and liking them so my life is easier, and its not like my parents are people I can go to anyways either so meaning of mom and dad has lost its value

I heard my mom crying the other night to my stepdad about me calling my stepmom too because she thinks its a special thing to be called and it hurts her feelings that she isn't special to me.

I don't want to be mean to anyone and don't want to sink to their levels. I understand that there are winners and losers in life and maybe im just a loser and destined to be put last in the families so if I am an asshole I will stop doing this.

edit: I don't know how my dad feels about me calling my stepdad dad but he also supported that I call no one else mom and dad",0.93,12,0,12
